# Client

Minimal React setup served via Express.

## Usage

```
npm install
npm start
```

The client connects to the backend via Socket.IO and provides a simple interface to import playlists. Use the **Login with Spotify** link to authenticate before adding playlists. You can register and log in with the simple form on the main page.
