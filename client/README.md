# Client

Minimal React setup served via a small Node.js HTTP server.

## Usage

```
node server.js
```
Run `../install.sh` before starting the client to ensure the server configuration exists, or open `http://localhost:3000/install` to use the web installer.

The client provides a simple interface to import playlists and manage users. Use the **Login with Spotify** link to authenticate before adding playlists. You can register and log in with the simple form on the main page.
